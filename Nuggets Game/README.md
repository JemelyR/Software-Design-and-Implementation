# CS50 Nuggets
## DR.JR, Winter 2023

This repository contains the code for the CS50 "Nuggets" game, in which players explore a set of rooms and passageways in search of gold nuggets.
The rooms and passages are defined by a *map* loaded by the server at the start of the game.
The gold nuggets are randomly distributed in *piles* within the rooms.
Up to 26 players, and one spectator, may play a given game.
Each player is randomly dropped into a room when joining the game.
Players move about, collecting nuggets when they move onto a pile.
When all gold nuggets are collected, the game ends and a summary is printed.
